**What is a diamond?**

Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years. Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres in the Earth's mantle. Under high pressure and temperature, carbon-containing fluids dissolved various minerals and replaced them with diamonds. Much more recently (tens to hundreds of million years ago), they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites.Diamonds are extremely rare, with concentrations of at most parts per billion in source rock.

**Why are diamonds so valuable?**

Diamonds of a certain size, generally half a carat and above, are traded and processed by the industry individually. Each has unique attributes and a corresponding unique market place. 

Diamonds of smaller sizes are traded in parcels of similar stones, called 'melee'.
